#2. Perform the following:
  #(a) Define a normalized vector P.
P <- 1:10/sum(1:10)
#(b) Define a normalized vector Q.
Q <- 20:29/sum(20:29)

#(c) Combine P and Q as matrix object. Please note that when defining a matrix from
#vectors, the vectors should be combined as rows.
x <- rbind(P,Q)

#d compute the Euclidean Distance with default parameters
stats::dist(x, method = "euclidean")

#3. Compute Manhattan distance and cosine similarity after performing (a),(b),(c) steps of
#Q.2.

stats::dist(x, method = "manhattan")
